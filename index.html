        <h2>
          Mercury & Venus are the only 2 planets in our solar system that have
          no moons.
        </h2>
        <p>
          In total, there are 176 confirmed moons that orbit the planets in our
          solar system, with some of them being bigger than Mercury itself!

          If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart.s
        </h2>

        <p>
          For 20 years, a team of astronomers observed a star at the center of
          our galaxy orbiting a black hole. The star has now got close enough to
          the black hole for “gravitational redshift” to occur which is where
          the star’s light loses energy as the black hole’s gravity intensified.
        </p>

        <h2>The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus.</h2>

        <p>
          Most people think that this would be Mercury, as it is the closest
          planet to the sun. However, Venus has a lot of gasses in its
          atmosphere which creates a “Greenhouse Effect” that causes a constant
          temperature of 864° Fahrenheit (462° Celsius) everywhere on the
          plant’s surface.

        <h2>Our solar system is 4.57 billion years old.</h2>
        <p>
          Well, give or take 30 million years(ish). Accurately speaking, it is
          4.571 billion years old. Scientists estimate that in about 5 billion
          years, our Sun will expand becoming a Red Giant. In about 7.5 billion
          years its expanding surface will swallow up and engulf the Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Enceladus, one of Saturn’s smaller moons, reflects 90% of the Sun’s
          light.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because Enceladus’ icy surface reflects sunlight rather than absorbing
          it, temperatures reach as low as -394° Fahrenheit (-201° Celsius).
        </p>

        <h2>
          The highest mountain discovered is the Olympus Mons, which is located
          on Mars.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Its peak is 16 miles (25 km) high, making it nearly 3 times higher
          than Mount Everest. And not only is it tall, but it’s also 374,015 ft²
          (114,000 m²) wide – that’s an area the size of Arizona!
